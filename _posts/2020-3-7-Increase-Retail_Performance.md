## How to increase profits
 
There are many ways to accomplish this. A general manager could:
* focus on increasing sales
* creating sales promotions
* making scheduling efficiencies
* cutting operating costs and much more.
 
After crunching the data for this store, I found that the sales have gone up month-over-month. There are some strong sales people on staff and the overall health of this retail store is quite good. However, there’s always room to improve and when I delved into the data I noticed some patterns.

Some staff members make significantly more sales than others. The top seller accounts for almost a quarter of all sales for the store. Another staff member accounts for less than one percent of sales. At first glance, one might think that a simple solution to increase profits is to fire the lowest performing staff members. This would be a prudent option, but more context is needed. What if some staff members have mixed responsibilities?  Some staff members might do a lot of “non-sales” work for the business.
 
So, it wouldn’t make sense to fire based on sales performance. This graph alone doesn’t reallly provide actionable information. A manager could infer that some cross training of staff members to do more duties could reduce costs. Not enough is available to back-up that claim, however.
 
Let’s look at the customer volume for the time-frame of the data.

On a side note, this graph also provides a very detailed visual representation of the history of the employees staffed.
 
Anyway, each bar on this histogram represent two days. Each bar is broken down into different colors that represent each employee. This graph is quite a powerful visualization of trends in customer volume within the time-frame. Managerial staff can glean actionable information to make important decisions using it.  More specifically, scheduling efficiencies could be made from simply glancing at the graph above.
 
Believe it or not, scheduling efficiencies can really help a manager raise profits for a company. However, without such data and visuals finding those efficiencies can be hard.
 
 
To further go down that thread, let’s look at the next graph.
 
![3](https://github.com/ssbyrne89/ssbyrne89.github.io/blob/master/img/HeatmapOfAverages%20(1).jpg?raw=true)
 
It is a heat-map based off the average ticket sales per hour per day of the month. This graph can be used in conjunction with the histogram to determine more scheduling efficiences. However, another strategy can involve creating incentive's for sales staff. 
 
A manager can implement a reward system for staff members based on this heat-map. Since the average sales ticket is summed for each day of the month, a manager can reward each employee who makes sales above the average for any given day. If an employee can sell above the average for the day then they are raising the average sales for the business. That increases revenue.
 
## CONCLUSION
The main conclusion is simple. The ability to collect and analyze business data allows a manager, owner, etc… to confidently make decisions that can drive up profits.
